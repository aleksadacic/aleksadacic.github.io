            <b>Data Querying</b> is a lightweight and intuitive library designed to make dynamic query building
            in <b>Spring Data JPA effortless</b>.
            <br><br>
            <p>
                DataQuerying is a Spring-based library I built to make complex database querying feel simple and
                consistent across an application. Instead of writing custom repositories or endless JPA Criteria code,
                you send a
                structured request (filters, sorting, paging, projections) and the library builds the query for you. It
                supports dynamic conditions, nested fields, and mapping results into DTOs, so the back end stays clean
                and
                the front end can ask for exactly what it needs. I made it because I was tired of copy-pasting query
                logic across services—this turns it into one reusable, testable piece.
